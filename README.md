# Heart Disease Prediction App ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Overview
The **Heart Disease Prediction App** is a user-friendly tool built with **Streamlit** that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease. It also provides an intuitive interface for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training.

You can access the live app here: **[Heart Disease Prediction App](https://heart-analysis.streamlit.app/)**.

## Features
1. **Heart Disease Prediction**:  
   - Users can input personal and medical details to predict their likelihood of having heart disease.
   - Provides actionable recommendations and thoughtful advice based on predictions.
   - Displays user input data and model accuracy after predictions.

2. **Model Training**:  
   - Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** on the provided medical dataset.
   - Displays the model's accuracy and feature importance.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Displays dataset statistics and previews.
   - Visualizes:
     - Correlation matrix (heatmap).
     - Feature distributions.
     - Target variable distribution.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the `app.py` file.
2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Place your dataset (e.g., `Medicaldataset.csv`) in the same directory as the `app.py` file.
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
